## :dart: About ##

This code extracts the Flow metrics for jira work items associated with a specific jira board - i.e how long issues spend in different stages of a workflow in Jira.
The extracted data can be used to generate insights which helps the team to effectively inspect and adapt.

**Below are the list of flow metrics**
- Cycle Time: time it takes to complete one unit of work from start to finish ( `End date - Start date + 1` )
- Workitem Issue Age: the amount of time a specific task (work item) has been in progress since it first started.
- Work In Progress Count: the total number of tasks or items that are currently being worked on but haven't yet been finished.
- Throughput:  the rate at which something gets completed.

**What it does:**

- Connects to your Jira instance using your credentials.
- Allows you to choose a specific project query (board) to analyze.
- Figures out the different stages (columns) in that workflow.
- Retrieves all issues associated with the chosen query.
- Analyzes the issue history to see when each issue moved between stages.
- Saves the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: Track how issues are aging in your system;\
:heavy_check_mark: Super charge your planning and forecast based on real data;


## :white_check_mark: Requirements ##

-Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have following things
  - **Install the required packages**
    - Mac
      - Open terminal, go to the project directory and install package using requirement.txt (you will find the requirement.txt under the project folder)
        - `pip3 install -r requirement.txt`
    - Windows
      - Open command line, go to the project directory and install package using requirement.txt
        - `pip install -r requirement.txt`
  - **Create Personal Jira Access Token**: create your personal jira access token (from your jira instance)
    - check this for reference on how to create personal token: [manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)  
  - **Store Jira Token**: you can either store the jira token in your machine's environment variable or as plain text in this code's configuration file.
    - **Store in Environment Variable**: Set an environment variable on your machine to store your jira token value. Please remember the name of the environment variable (for example: `jira_token`) which will be used in the application configuration settings. Check details -> [Setting Environment Variable](EnvVarDoc.md) 
    - **Storing in application configuration file**: details provided in the configuration section.
  
## :robot: Configurations ##
:pushpin: Please create 2 configuration files under `config` folder :file_folder: with below name and content. Update the config values to match your requirements.
:scissors: You can find sample config files under :file_folder: `config` folder which you can rename for quick start.

1. Configuration Setting for this project

    File : `config/config.yaml`
    ```
   # How to connect to JIRA?
    jira_url: https://jira.abc.com # the url of your jira instance

    jira_token_config: 
      mode: env_var # env_var or string
      value: jira_token # if (mode = env_var) then environment variable name. if (mode = string) then personal jira token value.

    # output date format
    output_date_format: "%Y-%m-%d" # any python supported date format
    #jira board configuration file name
    jira_board_config_filename: jira_board_config.yaml 
    generate_flow_metrics_report: false # true or false based on if the flow metrics reports need to be generated
    ```

    | Name  | Description | Default Value | Mandatory |
    | :----| :----      | :---         | :---         |
    | `jira_url`| the url of your jira instance| None | Yes |
    | `jira_token_config`| Jira token related configuration settings| None | Yes |
    | `mode`| Specifies the mode for stoarge for the jira token. It can either be set to `env_var` if the token is saved in your machine's environment variable or `string` if you want to store it in this configuration file. | None |  Yes |
    | `value`| It should either specify the environment variable name if `mode: env_var` or the value of your jira token if `mode: string` | None |  Yes |
    | `output_date_format`| Check [Python Dates](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datetime.asp) for the options you have (or ask ChatGPT). For example <br> * `"%Y%m%d"` for [TWiG by ActionableAgile](https://analytics.actionableagile.com/twig/index.html) <br> * `"%Y-%m-%d"` for excel operations | None |  Yes |
    | `jira_board_config_filename`| Name of the configuration file to get jira board related setting. This file should reside under config folder| None |  Yes |
    | `generate_flow_metrics_report`| This feature of generating Flow Graphs is still under construction, so either omit/remove this or set it to `false`. | false | No |

2. Configuration of the jira board from which the data will be extracted

    File: `config/jira_board_config.yaml`
      ```
        boards:
        - name: SAMPLE1
          jql_exclude_issue_type: Epic, Program, Test, subTaskIssueTypes()
          board_id: 12819
        - name: Jira
          jql_exclude_issue_type: subTaskIssueTypes()
          board_id: 11102
      ```

    | Name  | Description | Default Value | Mandatory |
    | :----| :----      | :---         | :---         |
    |`name`|Short name for the board configured. This will appear when you execute code as one of the options|None| Yes |
    |`jql_exclude_issue_type`| Specify the list of issue types which needs to be excluded (separated by comma). If this attribute is not mentioned then all issue types from the board are retrieved. <br> * Please ensure that it does not contain double quotes (") and are replaced by single quotes (')|None| No |
    |`board_id`|the jira board id, for example (https://jira.abc.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=12345)  the number after rapidview. This board info will be used for getting issues and related board workflow.|None| Yes |
    |`show`|this is an optional value and can be set to `show: false` or `show: true`. This value ensures (non) visibility of this listing when the program is executed.|true| No |
